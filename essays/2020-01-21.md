For my spring 2021 semester at UH Manoa, I will be taking a class where I learn the major concepts of Javascript. In this class, I will be learning how to apply my Javascript code and
learn other aspects of Javascript and coding in general, such as quality assurance of user interface. I am excited for my future in this course because it looks very promising for
my future with software engineering.

## Intial Impressions: A Retrospective on Coding Experience

Javascript as a language appears to be very similar to languages that I've already been introduced to, such as C++, or Python. Because of that, I feel a great familiarity with Javascript. However, I might just be overzealous because its early in the year and I am just doing well with it. I will be planning to keep up my studies and I will not get
complacent. I shall study for a couple hours everyday so that I am on par wtih my peers.

If my learning of Javascript goes better or just as well as my past experiences with other coding languages, then I should master Javascript just nicely. As time goes on, it feels
like it gets relatively easier to learn more languages because of each coding language relates to one another. 


## Javascript as of Now

As of the date that this is being posted, I am participating in "Workout of the Day" (WODs) which are, in terms of software engineering, timed practices of Javascript problems. Currently, I believe that I am doing well since I am able to finish WODs in the standard time they should be finished. However, finishing it in a smaller amount of time would give me a better peace of mind.

I am currently viewing screencasts to learn more about Javascript beyond the elementary courses and exercises on freecodecamp.org. They come in a form of a module which encapsulates an aspect of Javascript, and I look forward to this way of learning.


## My Future With Javascript

I am not entirely sure how much I will be using Javascript in my future career, but hopefully it takes up a significant amount because I enjoy learning it. I feel like I will master
Javascript by the end of the Spring 2021 school semester and hopefully I will also do well in terms of grading in the course I am taking. I also hope to take part in some big projects with Javascript, in class and outside of class. 

## Paving a Path for My Future

I hope that Javascript allows me to rocket into other coding languages as well, hopefully what I learn in this class, and what I am able to do with Javascript I am able to apply it to 
other coding languages.
