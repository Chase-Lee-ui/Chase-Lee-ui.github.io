## Open Source Software Development


## Agile Project Management
Agile Project Management is a super useful procedure that software engineers do to get things done and to get them done fast and orderly. So Agile is basically coming together
as a group and identifying the problems that need to be solved for a program and to distribute these problems amongst team members. This can be done over in a collaborative 
github repository where people can create branches of the main project and add in their piece of code and as a team make changes to the master all at the same time. The code
them all combines at the master and produces the product the the software engineering team had set out on.
