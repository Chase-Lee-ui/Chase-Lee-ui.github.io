# Finding a Way Out
Asking questions about programming is similar to finding your way out of a forest. In order to get out you need to know what direction you need to go in, otherwise you will just
head further into the forest. Figuring out the path you're going down in programming can be key to approaching problems, and understanding whether or not you're on the right path,
you need to figure out whats in your surroundings. After reading "[How To Ask Questions the Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)," it can be said there are
good ways to approach problems than just asking "what happend."

## Good Questions: It's Okay to Be New
It is okay to ask seemingly "newbie" questions, just as long as you have done the preliminary searches. In order to ask the correct question, you need to know what you're working
with and do everything you need to do. Do not quit to ask a question at the first roadblock in the coding journey, because not only does it hinder your ability to critically think
in programming, it gives you a habitual reliance on asking questions to places like StackOverflow. In other words, the more you can do the better. However, no one is immune to times
where they are absolutely stumpted so they ask sources on how to improve one's code. This [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1168807/how-can-i-add-a-key-value-pair-to-a-javascript-object) on StackOverflow provides a nice example on what a good question may look like. Just by glancing at the question it appears that the user who posted the question
knows what hes working with, that they just need a little push in the right direction. They use proper grammar, punctuation, and spacing. Not only that but they have completely
identified their problem and made their post clear and succint.

Although to some veteran javascript coders, this may look like quite a elementary problem. People are out there to help, just remember to be courteous to those that provide help,
and do not be a nuisance. Your questions can also help others that may be stuck on similar problems. 

## Bad Questions: A Lesson in What Not to Do
There are definitely sub-optimal ways to ask questions, but identifying the patterns that allows bad questions to exist will give insight into how they form. For one, people who
may post bad questions might not even know what they're working on, they might not be able to explain the process to how they got to where they are. Returning to the forest analogy 
from earlier, identifying landmarks and relaying it to the search team can definitely help them find you. Identifying landmarks would be similar to know the names of various things
in programming.

And another thing is to definitely not ask any homework looking questions. The user of this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65943921/program-wont-print-out-amount-of-characters-that-are-in-a-file) does not seem to appear to know a thing about their work. This user also seems to exhibit the patterns of someone who may ask bad questions. Just at
a glance of their code it does not take a professional  to a major problem in their code, that being the random "return 0" statement in the middle of the main. He does not even
explain everything in his code, nor things he has already done to fix the problem. This user also seems to be posting what appears to be a question for their homework.
