Square-Bound is a puzzle-platformer game where me and my peers had created completely from scratch. This experience had enlightened me and my team to many aspects of game design
stages. This game was made using C# in the Unity Engine, we had to complete this project within 2 weeks of the theme being announced. I was able to juggle work and school to
produce a game that I am satisfied with.

I had created the art, and most of the code. However, every aspect of the game was discussed about in detail so that all participating members understood and agreed
on the proposed ideas. The story of the game is that a square was captured and it is trying to return to its family. Through solving puzzles, the square should be able to achieve
his goal.

Organizing a team was an enthrilling experience, and I look forward to designing more games within the near future. 

You can play and download the game at [my itch.io page](https://snekuchan.itch.io/square-bound).
