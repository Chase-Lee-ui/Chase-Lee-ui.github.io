## Overview
Campus Clearout Center is a project that allows UH Manoa community members to buy items that other members of the UH Manoa community are willing to part with for a small sum
of cash. This program was made by the work of my teammates and I.

## Contributions
I was an active contributed to this project as I had updated the general style of the website and made multiple pages.
