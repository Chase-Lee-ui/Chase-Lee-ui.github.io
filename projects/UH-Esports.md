I play for the UH Esports team as a member of team black. I played support in the game. This experience had really built my communication skills and confidence
working with teams. I had to take criticism and apply it critically in practice. Like traditional sports, there need to be time commitments which I was able to handle
as I juggled school and work. 

This was such an enjoyable experience to play with my peers on a competitive level, I was also able to make some connections out of it as well. This connections expand
to different sectors of the gaming industry. To name one, UH Esports is in association with Cloud 9, a reputable company that has high-level gaming teams. In the student
program, stuidents can view the different aspects of running an organization such as Cloud 9. Whether it be advertisement, product development, or building public relations,
Cloud 9 representatives are there to help students if they can.

Kevin Nguyen, a UH Esports Coordinator, has helped me apply to gaming industries and provided me with many resources so that I can be successful. I believe that anyone who joins the
UH Esports community can help grow their career in the gaming field, whether it be marketing or software engineering, there is a place for many people at UH Esports.
